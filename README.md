# Number Guessing Game

- This is a simple Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and challenges the user to guess it.
- The program prompts the user to input their guess, compares it to the generated number, and provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low. 
- It continues until the user correctly guesses the number and then displays the number of attempts it took to win the game.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the program is located.
4. Run the program by executing the following command:
 
    python Guessing_Game.py
    
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to guess the number.
6. The program will provide feedback if your guess is too high or too low.
7. Continue guessing until you correctly guess the number.
8. Once you guess the number correctly, the program will display the number of attempts it took to win the game.

## Example Output
